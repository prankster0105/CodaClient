# CodaClient
Minecraft client integrated for use with other mods using the Fabric modloader, providing most definitely a substantial increase in FPS, and in general an incredible improvement in performance even for the lowest ends of devices.

## Installation
Go to 'Releases' and download the latest release, place the .jar in your mods folde. As far as I know, it should work for any version from 1.16 and up.

The mod is only for Fabric, and there are no plans (at the time of writing this) of porting a Forge version.

### NOTE:
For the client to work, it is required to use at least Java 16.

## About
Name says it all: Coda Client.

It is definitely a client.

The client provides a substantial increase in FPS and improvement in performance in general, repairing many things and by default is bundled with LazyDFU optimisation (definitely), alongside a fix in the leading cause of memory leaks on the JVM.
