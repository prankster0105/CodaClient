# CodaClient

## Installation 
Go to 'Releases' and download the latest release, place the .jar in your mods folder. As far as I know, it should work for any version from 1.16 and up

The mod is only for Fabric, there are no plans of porting to a Forge version

## About
Name says it all: CodaClient.

It is definitely a client.

The client provides a substantial increase in FPS and improvement in performance in general, repairing many things and by default is bundled with LazyDFU optimisation (definitely), alongside a fix in the leading cause of memory leaks on the JVM.
